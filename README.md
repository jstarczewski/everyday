# everyday
Simple android app to help people achieve their goals v2.
#About Everyday!
This is the v2 (2018) version of my DayOne (app created back in 2017). Both Apps share similar funcionality but different architecture. <br/> During coding <b>Everyday!<b> I learned and practiced how to :<br/> 
* follow a basic Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture (when needed).
* implement Room persistance library to store repetitive, bigger amounts of data
* implement RecyclerView different way to ease displaying data 
* use AsyncTasks with weak references to do small tasks on the background thread
* use interfaces more complex way to ease development process
